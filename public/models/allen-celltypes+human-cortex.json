  "abstract": "To investigate the cellular diversity across human cortex, we used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing that provides a relatively unbiased survey of cell types and can be applied to neurosurgical and frozen, postmortem tissue. Individual layers of cortex were dissected from brain tissues including the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), anterior cingulate gyrus (CgGr), primary visual cortex (V1C), primary motor cortex (M1C), primary somatosensory cortex (S1C) and primary auditory cortex (A1C), and nuclei were dissociated and sorted using the neuronal marker NeuN. In total, nuclei from MTG were sampled from four postmortem donor brains and four neurosurgical donor brains and nuclei from the remaining regions were sampled from 3 postmortem donor brains. Profiled nuclei included approximately 90% neurons and 10% glia, and layer sampling was based on the relative number of neurons in each layer. Additional nuclei were sampled from deep layers of cortex to reflect the transcriptomic diversity of neurons in those layers. More than 49,000 nuclei were sequenced using SMART-Seq v4 across the 6 cortical regions, resulting in an estimated detection of neuronal cell types as rare as 0.2% of all neurons. Data from matched brain regions in mouse also allows for direct comparison of cell types between species.\n\nThis data set includes single-nucleus transcriptomes from 76,533 total nuclei derived from 2 post-mortem human brain specimens, to survey cell type diversity in the primary motor cortex (M1C or M1). The data were generated as part of a BICCN collaboration to characterize cell type diversity in M1 across species and data modalities. In total, 127 transcriptomic cell types were identified.",
